Only these 2 faces were showed in Noesis. I ripped 2-3 times. All you need to its to finish the rectangle and apply the textures.
Look at the screenshot to see how it looks like.
Also, the tvs that go out of the pile are the same model multiply by 6 which is the reason why theres one file for them.
