How to set the npc in the unity engine:
you need the scripts inside the editor as well

step 1: place the Enemy.prefab on the editor, make sure the object
has the script assigned.

step 2: create an empty object called Gamemanager and put the script
in it, it's required to assign the player prefab.

step 3: grab the player controller prefab you're currently using on
the player space, don't worry, it can be any player controller and
doesn't need anything specific to make the AI working.

although i've made a simple tutorial on how to set it up, the thing
is, we aren't done, if you go right now an try to test it, it won't move
and no error will pop up as well, because you need to tell the AI
where to walk:

-go to the window tab on the engine, go to AI and select "navigation".

-a new tab will be shown on the right, select the terrain while on this
tab

-make sure the navigation area is set up to "walkable" and make
sure the navigation static is checked.

-change from 'object' to 'bake' on the same tab and click "bake".

if you followed the instructions well, the ground will have a "blue"
strange thing on it, don't worry about, now go and play and if you
hit F near the NPC it will succesfully follow you.
